## The Multi-Objective Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP)

The objective of the QAP is to minimize the total cost of the assignment, which is typically measured by the sum of the distances between each pair of facilities and the corresponding pair of locations. The optimization problem attempts to minimize multiple different objective functions.

The Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP). The QAP is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem that asks the following question: "Given a set of n facilities and a set of n locations, what is the optimal assignment of facilities to locations such that the sum of the distances between each facility and its corresponding location multiplied by the weight of the flow between these two facilities is minimized?"
